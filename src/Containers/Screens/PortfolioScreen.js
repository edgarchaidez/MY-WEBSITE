          <p>Hi, this is Edgar. </p>
          <p>
            I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Arizona State University
            <span role="img" aria-label="party popper">
              {" "}
              ðŸŽ‰
            </span>
            and I'm currently searching for a full time job position as a
            software/full-stack engineer. I've always been interested in
            creating user facing applications and especially ones that
            hopefully make people's lives a bit better. I'm also continuing my
            education with a Master of Computer Science at ASU so
            internship opportunities are also welcomed.
